                <h1 class = "AM-title">About Me</h1>
                <p class="About-me"> I am a dedicated and hardworking individual currently studying for my multiverse level 4 Software Engineering apprenticeship which I started on the 30th September 2024. I ensure I always help out at work when and where I can, as this provides me with a sense of fulfilment and also makes my days more enjoyable. I like to focus on building relationships with those I work with.

                <h1 class = "IH-T">Interests and Hobbies</h1>
                <p class="IH"> During my time at school, I took extra subjects to boost my overall grades but also to help me develop areas I had a genuine interest in. This included the EPQ which I used to develop a tutoring website for those undertaking their GCSE’s and both the LiBF finance CeFS and DipFS as the world of finance was fascinating to me. Outside of work I love to get out the house whether that’s to go for a run, play golf or even just meetup with my friends. Because a lot of my friends have gone to uni I’ve been getting more into gaming. This had included Fortnite multiplayer, Minecraft, Terraria, Subnautica and even Skylanders for a bit of nostalgia.
